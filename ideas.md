# Project Aim

Provide a user-friendly interface using C++ Standard Library paradigms and concepts

As a library user, I want:

- interop with C++ Standard Library types especially with containers std::vector and std::array
- an iterator-based interface
- standard implementations of common algorithms and selected C++ Standard Library algorithms
- extensive support for multi-dimensional buffers including multi-dimensional versions of selected standard algorithms
- an async interface using futures

As a library user, it would be nice to have

- a C++20 ranges-like interface including kernel composition
- a C++20 module library
